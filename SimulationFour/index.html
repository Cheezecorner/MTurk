        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        In the next screen, you will be presented with two panels, side by side.
        <br/>Each panel will contain a random assortment of 40 to 200 <b style="color:blue;">blue</b> and 20 to 100 <b style="color:orange;">orange</b> marbles for 1 to 5 seconds.
        <br/>After you finish observing each panel, you will be asked
        <ol>
            <li>How many <b style="color:orange;">orange</b> marbles you thought there were in each panel, and</li>
            <li>How confident you were about your guess.</li>
        </ol>
        A higher confidence yields a higher reward, awarded only if the actual number of marbles lands within a narrower range.
        <br/>You will be rewarded <i>only for one</i> of the two panels after you complete <i>both!</i>
        <br/>
